# Waldman Rocket Program (WaRP)
WaRP, short for **Wa**ldman **R**ocket **P**rogram, is a model rocket simulator created by Philip Waldman.

## Features
* Calculates and plots the ballistic trajectory of 1-, 2-, and 3-D input data.
    * 1-D is plotted with time on the x-axis and altitude on the y-axis.
    * 2-D is plotted with horizontal location one the x-axis and altitude on the y-axis.
    * 3-D is plotted with altitude on the z-axis and x and y location on the x- and y-axis respectively. There are 4 views, top-left is looking down from above, bottom-left is looking parallel with the x-axis, bottom-right is parallel with the y-axis, and top-right is a 3-D view.
